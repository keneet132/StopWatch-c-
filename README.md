# StopWatch-c++
a simple cli stopwatch written completely in c++. it shows hours,minutes and seconds.
libraries i used are iostream,thread and chrono.
## about this project
note that this is still one of my first c++ project which i only made to get familiar with the language. undoubtedly this code has a lot of potential to be optimized.
if you want to build on top of my code feel free to do so.
